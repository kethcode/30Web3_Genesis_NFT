# 30-Web3 Genesis Cohort NFT Reward Project

We decided to make the NFT rewards for the participants of our Cohort.

Three parts:
 - Contracts
 - Art
 - Front End

## Contracts

Proxy?
 - Considering a proxy to enable upgradable deployments
Participant Registry
 - Records project name and associated project wallets to send the NFT
NFT Token
 - The actual ERC721 token that will be sent to the participants
SVG Library
 - A collection of SVG functions to make element gneeration easier within the contract.

## Art

IPFS, SVG, or hybrid art.

Extra credit for fully on-chain.

## Front End

React application hosted on (Surge?), that interacts with the Registry to collect data, mint NFTs, and maybe display them.

Extra credit for ENS integration.
